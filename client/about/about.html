  <!-- <h1>Our Mission</h1> -->
  <p>

  We created EIR to help those overseas who cannot afford access to proper medical care. In the US we take for granted how awesome our health care access is.  Well overseas the people don't have this wonderful luxury. Time to give back to your global community in three easy steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Choose a patient</li>
    <li>Click donate</li>
    <li>Complete payment</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  After we receive your payment, we will send you regular updates about your patient -- from diagnosis, to prognosis, to surgery, to post-operative care.  We'll keep you posted!
