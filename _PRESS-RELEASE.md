EIR

## Heading ##
Eir

## Sub-Heading ##
To crowdfund those who lack monetary access to properly fund medical treatments. 

## Summary ##
Eir displays profiles, summaries of the patient's treatment, and how much it would be to fund the medical treatment. Anyone in the world is able to fund the treatment on the website. 

## Problem ##
Millions of people lack proper resources in funds for very treatable conditions. At the same time, there are people in developed countries who are willing to fund it, especially when there is transparency about where their money is going. 

## Solution ##
Eir takes out the middle man and makes it very clear where each dollar of a funder's donation is going to, which is the patient.
